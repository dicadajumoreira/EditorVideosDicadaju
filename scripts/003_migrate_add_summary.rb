# Migration script: Add `summary` field to video entries that predate the
# summarize-video skill.
#
# The summarize-video skill produces a short markdown summary of each video
# from its visual transcript. Libraries created before that skill existed have
# no `summary:` key in their video entries. Missing means "todo" — the same
# convention as `transcript:` and `visual_transcript:`. The migration inserts
# an empty `summary:` line directly after each `visual_transcript:` line.
#
# Video entries that already have `summary:` are left alone. Video entries
# without `visual_transcript:` (mid-pipeline videos) are skipped — they'll get
# a `summary:` field added by the parent agent when their visual transcript is
# produced.
#
# This migration edits the file textually — it does not round-trip through
# YAML, so quote styles and indentation elsewhere in the file are preserved
# exactly.
#
# Usage: ruby scripts/003_migrate_add_summary.rb [library_name]
#        ruby scripts/003_migrate_add_summary.rb --all
